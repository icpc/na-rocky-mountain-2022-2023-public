\problemname{Champernowne Count}

The $n$th Champernowne word is obtained by writing down the first $n$
positive integers and concatenating them together. For example, the
10th Champernowne word is ``12345678910''.

Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$, count how many of the first $n$ Champernowne words are divisible by $k$.

\section*{Input}

The single line of input contains two integers, $n$ $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$ and $k$ $(1 \le k \le 10^9)$.

\section*{Output}

Output a single integer, which is a count of the first $n$ Champernowne words divisible by $k$.
