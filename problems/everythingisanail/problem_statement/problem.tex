\problemname{Everything Is A Nail}

As an employee of the Iffy Colossal Pinnacle
Construction (ICPC) company building a very tall skyscraper, you have
a number of tasks to complete high above the ground in a specific
order.  You can always choose to skip a task, but you fear that doing
so too many times might cause some catastrophic failure of the
building. You cannot revisit or complete a task once it has been
skipped.

Each task is a nail, a screw, or a bolt. You have three tools: a
hammer (works on nails), a screwdriver (works on screws), and a wrench
(works on bolts). When you start a new task you can choose to switch
your tool out by dropping it (hopefully no one was below you at
the time), but when you do so you permanently lose the dropped tool.

Given the list of tasks in the order they should be completed,
determine the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.  You may choose to
use any tool as the initial tool.


\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains an integer $n$
($1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5$), which is the number of tasks you need
to complete.  

Each of the next $n$ lines contains a single integer $t$ ($0 \le t \le 2$). These are the tasks, in order.
Each task is one of $0$ (nail), $1$ (screw), or $2$ (bolt).

\section*{Output}

Output a single integer, which is the maximum number of tasks that can be
completed.
